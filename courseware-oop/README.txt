ABOUT THE COURSEWARE

Note that Python 3.6 or later is *required* for this class.

This folder has course materials you will use in the class:

* slides - Slide decks used in the class.

* labs - In-class programming exercises. Your instructor will lead you
  through them.

* solutions - Solutions to the labs. IMPORTANT: We've found that
  students learn and retain FAR MORE when you only peek at solutions
  when you truly, absolutely need a hint to get un-stuck. Always do as
  much as you can on your own, so you'll learn a lot! When you are
  done, THEN always compare what you wrote to the official solution;
  if it's any different, that will teach you even more.
